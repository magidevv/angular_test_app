# CurrencyApp

The Currency Converter app is an interactive tool that allows users to conveniently convert currency from one currency to another based on the latest exchange rates. Users can enter an amount in one currency, select a currency to convert, and receive an equivalent amount in the selected currency.

The application receives the latest exchange rates from an open API, which allows you to always have up-to-date information on currency rates. Additionally, users can exchange between two currencies by selecting them from the list of available currencies.

The components of the application include input fields for the amount and currency selection, a button to start the conversion, and display the result of the conversion. The app also has a function to automatically update exchange rates to ensure accurate results.

With a simple and clear interface, the "Currency Converter" application provides users with a convenient way to quickly and efficiently convert currency and receive up-to-date information on exchange rates.
